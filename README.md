This is a project that predicts the sea level change through year 2050. The data is sourced from EPA's Climate Change Indicators in the United States; the link being `www.epa.gov/climate-indicators`- Data source: CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2016. It's a dataset that shows the Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2015.
This project is part of my research works in FreeCodeCamp: an online accredited source,  and it predicts that there would be an increasing rise in sea level as the years go by.
